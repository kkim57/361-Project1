Particles are centimeters to decameters in size and are ice (some may be covered with ice); there are traces of silicate and carbon minerals. There are four main ring groups and three more faint, narrow ring groups separated by gaps called divisions.</td>
        <td>Uranus has a system of narrow, faint rings. Ring particles are dark, and could consist of rocky or carbonaceous material.</td>
        <td>	Rings are narrow, and contain concentrations of particles called ring arcs.</td>
